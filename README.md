**CNN-based detection of geometric shapes in images, and reasoning-based question answering**

This project uses OpenNARS for visual question answering about shape drawings, utilizing output from a Convolutional Neural Network which was trained on a variation of Shapeset.

See the report for more information: https://github.com/patham9/CNN_NARS_Shapeset_QA/blob/master/ML_ProjectReport_PatrickHammer.pdf

And for the implementation (using TensorFlow for the CNN + OpenNARS), have a look at: https://github.com/patham9/CNN_NARS_Shapeset_QA/blob/master/ShapeDetector.ipynb

**CNN-based detection of geometric shapes in images, and reasoning-based question answering**
![Drawings Q/A](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8284677/71530408-902f6800-28e1-11ea-8d22-3493aee2c4d4.png)

This project uses OpenNARS for visual question answering about shape drawings, utilizing output from a Convolutional Neural Network which was trained on a variation of Shapeset.

See the report for more information: https://github.com/patham9/CNN_NARS_Shapeset_QA/blob/master/ML_ProjectReport_PatrickHammer.pdf

And for the implementation (using TensorFlow for the CNN + OpenNARS), have a look at: https://github.com/patham9/CNN_NARS_Shapeset_QA/blob/master/ShapeDetector.ipynb
